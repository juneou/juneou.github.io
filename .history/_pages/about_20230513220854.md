I am currently a fifth-year PhD student in computer science at SJTU, advised by Prof. [Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/) and Prof. [Haiming Jin](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~haimingjin/). Previously, I was an undergraduate in the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering in Beijing Jiao Tong University.

My research centers around data mining, machine learning and their broad applications (e.g., traffic prediction, knowledge graph reasoning). I am also interested in the interpretability study of deep forecasting model.
