I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at SJTU, advised by Prof. [Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/) and Prof. [Haiming Jin](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~haimingjin/). I also work closely with Prof. [Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net/). Previously, I was an undergraduate in the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering in Beijing Jiao Tong University.

My research centers around time series forecasting, spatial-temporal data mining and their broad applications (e.g., traffic prediction, knowledge graph reasoning). I am also interested in the interpretability study of deep forecasting model.
